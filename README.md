# Drone Network for Search and Rescue (SAR) System

## Overview

This project explores a cooperative multi-UAV search and rescue (SAR) system combining decentralized coordination, onboard human detection, and disturbance-aware navigation.

Development is performed in simulation and deployed on real DJI Tello EDU drones. The goal is to study how coordination, perception, and environmental disturbances interact in constrained UAV environments.

## System Environments

- Multi-agent simulation in Python  
- Real-world deployment using DJI Tello EDU drones  

## Technologies

- Python  
- Multi-agent coordination  
- Computer vision  
- DJI Tello EDU SDK  

## Status

Early development. Simulation and hardware integration in progress.
